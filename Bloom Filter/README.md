# Instructions:

	1. To run the main code that prints out the outputs of both the serial and parallel version of the Bloom Filter, type 'make' into the terminal

	2. Then, type './run' into the terminal
		- This should show you the output of both the serial and parallel code for the Bloom Filter
	
# Note:

	- You can use 'make clean' to clean the 'run' file

	- You need to manually change the test files, query files, and the definition for the number of files in both the serial and parallel version of the code if you want to test different files. Otherwise, it will run the code of the combined files by default.

	- The job script only runs the parallel version of the Bloom Filter
